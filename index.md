Hello and welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in the City of New York. I research precipitation trends and variability in southeastern South America (SESA; southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina) in observations and climate model simulations. My goal is to better understand the drivers of past and present precipitation change so that we can better constrain projections of future precipitation change. I am co-advised by [Jason Smerdon](https://smerdon.ldeo.columbia.edu/people/jason-e-smerdon) at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and [Park Williams](https://www.aparkwilliams.com) of University of California, Los Angeles.

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at Stony Brook University where my I was advised by [Kevin Reed](https://you.stonybrook.edu/kareed/). During my M.S. I sought to understand global climate models ability to simulate the northerly extent of precipitation associatd with the North American monsoon. 

My academic journey began in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont where I recieved my B.S. in Atmospheric Science from Northern Vermont University (formerly Lyndon State College).
