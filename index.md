Hello and welcome! My name is Arianna and I am an assistant professor in the Department of Geography at Dartmouth College. Prior to starting at Dartmouth, I was a NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow working under the mentorship of [Jennifer Kay](https://cires.colorado.edu/research-groups/jennifer-kay-group) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I earned my Ph.D. at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in 2023 where I was co-advised by [Jason Smerdon](https://smerdon.ldeo.columbia.edu/people/jason-e-smerdon) of the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University and [Park Williams](https://www.aparkwilliams.com) of University of California, Los Angeles. My dissertation sought to understand what has driven the massive precipitation increase observed over southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina (collectively known as southeastern South America [SESA]) and why most climate model simulations underestimate the precipitation increase. As a postdoc, I am excited to build on the tools I developed during my Ph.D. to better understand the drivers of past and present precipitation change across the mid-latitudes so that we can better constrain future precipitation projections. Next year (Summer 2025), I will join the faculty at Dartmouth College in the Department of Geography as an Assistant Professor. 

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at Stony Brook University where I was advised by [Kevin Reed](https://you.stonybrook.edu/kareed/). During my M.S. I sought to understand global climate models ability to simulate the northerly extent of precipitation associated with the North American monsoon. 

My academic journey began in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont where I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Science from Vermont State University (formerly Lyndon State College).
